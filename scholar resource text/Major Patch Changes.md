# :bceEagerSit: **Job Changes coming to Dawntrail**

**Level 92:**
* Baneful Impaction is a new OGCD that becomes available for 30 seconds after using Chain Stratagem. Baneful Impaction does a total of 700p over 15 seconds in an aoe around the main target.

**Level 94: **
* Enhanced Swiftcast is a new trait that reduces our swiftcast cooldown to 40 seconds.
* Tactician's mastery is a new trait that increases Biolysis's damage over time effect to 75p(previously 70p) totaling 750p(previously 700p) over 30 seconds and Broil IV's potency to 310p(previously 295p)

**Level 96:**
* Concitation is an upgrade to Succor. Concitation provides a 180% shield compared to Succor which gives 160% shield. Be aware the shield is still the buff Galvanize.

**Level 98:**
* Enhanced Recitation is a trait that reduces Recitation cooldown to 60 seconds.

**Level 100:**
* Seraphism is our new capstone ability. When activated Seraphism regens all party members in a 50y radius around you for 100p while Seraphism is active
* Seraphism also changes Adloquium into Manifestation. Manifestation is an instant cast single target heal for 360p(adlo is 300p) with 180% shield based on the amount Manifestation healed for.
* Seraphism also changes Concitation to Accession. Accession is an instant cast aoe heal for 240p(succor is 200p) with a 180% shield based on the HP healed by Accession.
* Seraphism also resets the cooldown of Emergency Tactics and reduces its recast timer to 1 second allowing you to spam both shield and pure healing.

**Non leveled changes:**
* Chain has had its duration changed from 15 seconds to 20 seconds.
* So far Ruin II has not get a potency upgrade making using Ruin II a 90p damage lost to use vs Broil IV

# :bceHatBFit: **What do these changes mean for Scholar?**

Scholar in Dawntrail is simply a better version of itself in Endwalker. Seraphishm fills two major holes in scholars kit, total healing throughput and healing while moving; giving access to instant heals/shields and effectively a 20% healing boost to GCD healing, scholar can now better handle extreme healing checks, especially during high movement mechanics. 

The reduction of Recitation's cooldown to 60 second can easily allow for more uses of it even when it is paired with Deployment Tactics. Recitation is a flexible ability and extra uses of it allows Scholar to do so much more. It can be used for more consistent shield strength through guaranteed critical Succors in between Deploys, where it would also help with MP management, or simply for more free AoE healing through Recitation Indoms. While deployment is a 90 second cooldown and recitation is a 60 second cooldown you will often not be using deployment on cooldown every 90 seconds freeing up some room for recitation uses with other abilities and spells.

# :bceCoolShades:  **Does this make things harder on us**

Seraphism conflicts with Dissipation meaning you can't activate Seraphism while your fairy is away and you can't Dissipate while Seraphism is active. Dissipation now locks scholar out of even more of its toolkit which can cause problems and must be adjusted around.
