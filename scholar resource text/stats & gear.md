## **:bceExpert2: Please read the section on managing Piety below as well.**

:bceExpert2: Level 90 Stat Priority: Crit>DH>=Det for pre-BiS melding. Consider melding Det over DH for prog, as the damage benefits are basically equal on average. Meld SpS to a comfy tier if you wish, low priority during prog. 

Piety is a binary stat, as any more than you needed to not run out of mp was wasted stats. Because of this, when choosing our substats, avoiding excess Piety is the best way for us to increase our damage, and you'll sometimes see our low piety sets use lower ilvl equipment to avoid Piety (this is still the exception rather than the rule, don't actively use lower ilvl items to dodge Piety without calculating out the gain yourself). It's hard to predict exactly how much Piety you might need in most settings, but you can take a look at how much the recommended sets take in each setting and decide which one fits you best. Remember that slower GCD tiers use significantly less mana (1 less Broil per minute is 400 mp saved per minute) and can thus get away with less Piety. If you find yourself struggling with mp, ensure that you're effectively using your mp tools before adding more Piety. Swapping GCD heals for OGCD heals, using Aetherflow and Lucid Dreaming on cooldown, using Recitation  for a free GCD heals in a pinch: these are all effective ways to make your mp go farther. Also make sure to always carry Super-Ethers:hq: when raiding, they are a very effective way to recover from multiple rezzes or a death.

# Savage BiS

**2.40 set:** <https://xivgear.app/?page=sl%7Ce429375a-d530-4a70-996a-0782b5ed776a>
* This is the generally recommended set. It has great alignment for both Aetherflow and Chain Stratagem, and its slower GCD ensures that you will have more MP for raises and GCD healing.

**2.32 set:** <https://xivgear.app/?page=sl%7C2863d2d0-c97c-4d5e-8702-e61875a0d353>
* This set provides the highest simulated DPS. Despite its simulated DPS, its awkward GCD alignment for Chain Stratagem and its increased MP expenditure prevent it from being the default recommendation. It may not be as easy or comfortable to use as the 2.40 set, but its higher simulated DPS makes it a reasonable consideration.

* This set has relatively good alignment for Aetherflow, but this GCD causes Chain Stratagem to drift by 0.6-0.7s per use. That amount of drift may or may not matter.

* If your group's burst is not well timed, the slight Chain Stratagem drift is probably irrelevant. Even if your group's burst is coordinated, raid buffs tend to drift a little over the course of an encounter, so the slight Chain Stratagem drift might not actually cause it to be misaligned.

* If the encounter is short enough (less than 8 or 10 minutes), or if your group ever delays raid buffs because of mechanics or downtime, the slight Chain Stratagem drift should not be significant.

**2.31 set:** <https://xivgear.app/?page=sl%7C2a96ac4b-45f7-413b-a509-3cae2e524b78>
* This is a suitable alternative for players who prefer a faster GCD without dealing with the slightly awkward GCD alignment of the 2.32 set. Its simulated DPS is slightly worse, but it may be more comfortable to use, depending on your personal preference.

* Even with the faster GCD, this set's MP should still be perfectly sustainable in a somewhat organized environment where you do not expect to cast multiple raises or do a lot of GCD healing.

**Tome buy order:**
* *2.40:* week 1 gloves > week 2 earring > week 3 wrist > week 4 head > week 6 pants > week 7 ring
* *2.32:* week 1 gloves > week 2 earring > week 4 pants > week 5 head > week 6 ring
* *2.31:* week 1 gloves > week 2 earring > week 4 pants >  week 5 ring

# Occult Crescent BiS

**2.50 set:** <https://xivgear.app/?page=sl%7Cb80d1ba1-175f-4887-bfb6-3f0d01f250b4>

**2.41 set:** <https://xivgear.app/?page=sl%7C5f3b9273-17de-475c-88e8-d4126daaf0c9>

**2.40 set:** <https://xivgear.app/?page=sl%7C1b60f3a8-8ade-407c-8c9d-71417c309ace>


* 2.41 is the highest simmed set. But feel free to use whatever set you want 
* Chain/Aetherflow alignment matters less with the constant downtime between fates/CEs.
* Maxing SpS has decent value which you won't see in the sim because you get more uses of things like Occult Comet. Although you can realistically only get to 2.40 with the Occult armour

# Ultimate/Criterion Information
These sets are for non current ultimate content. For The Omega Protocol you can sync gear but it is way better to actually take the time to farm gear, you'll squeeze out more damage which can help with groups progging and playing a bit too safe.

**DSR**
*Read if doing 332 or for Piety options*

Consider replacing non-SpS accessories with Aug. Radiant earrings, Asphodelos necklace or Aug. Radiant ring.

The 332 strat for Akh Morn's Edge in P7 is a lot more demanding in GCD heals than the 611 strat. You should take more Piety than the minimum if you don't expect heals and mitigation to be planned and executed optimally with 332. Watch PoVs if unsure.


## Legacy Ultimate Sets:
If you're looking for BiS for legacy Ultimates or want to tell us about a better one you've found please check [this thread](https://discord.com/channels/277897135515762698/1399615687592513588/1399615832971022389). If you're having trouble finding the thread make sure you have scholar questions viewable.

All sorts of new gear combinations can come up as new patches release.
Having the best BiS people have found so far in one place means we can at least make the effort of searching through these possibilities collaborative.

## 2.5GCD and 2.49 GCD info

In the game, your global cooldown (GCD) timing is determined by when the game code aligns with your frame updates. This happens once per frame. If your next action doesn't sync perfectly with these frames, there can be slight delays in your GCD. This is especially noticeable on lower FPS. Fluctuating frame rates can also make your GCD more unpredictable. Over the course of a battle, these delays could mean that a gear set with a supposed 2.5 GCD might actually function more like a 2.505 GCD. Players with higher FPS will suffer the effects of this issue less but will never be able to fully eliminate them. 

Third-party tools like ReAction help to mitigate this effect by syncing your frames with when your GCD is ready. To better understand how this works for your specific character, you can make comparisons using a GCD calculator. By inputting fflogs into the calculator, you can see the actual duration of your GCDs during gameplay. It's advisable to use multiple logs for accuracy and disregard any anomalous data. For a practical tool to calculate GCDs, you can visit <https://gcdcalc.fly.dev/.>

## Dot Refresh 

If using the Early Refresh(DoT clip) opener: The 2.50 GCD and 2.49 GCD sets will NOT land Biolysis under Chain Stratagem if you use Biolysis AFTER your 6th Energy Drain in the opener (the breakpoint is 2.47 GCD and requires low ping). To fix this, use Biolysis on the same GCD as your 6th Energy Drain.

This write up by <@145919664575217664> helps explain how some gear sets could be better for parsing despite having weaker sim damage and overall performance.
