## **:bceExpert2: Please read the section on managing Piety below as well.**

:bceExpert2: Level 90 Stat Priority: Crit>DH>=Det for pre-BiS melding. Consider melding Det over DH for prog, as the damage benefits are basically equal on average. Meld SpS to a comfy tier if you wish, low priority during prog. 

Piety is a binary stat, as any more than you needed to not run out of mp was wasted stats. Because of this, when choosing our substats, avoiding excess Piety is the best way for us to increase our damage, and you'll sometimes see our low piety sets use lower ilvl equipment to avoid Piety (this is still the exception rather than the rule, don't actively use lower ilvl items to dodge Piety without calculating out the gain yourself). It's hard to predict exactly how much Piety you might need in most settings, but you can take a look at how much the recommended sets take in each setting and decide which one fits you best. Remember that slower GCD tiers use significantly less mana (1 less Broil per minute is 400 mp saved per minute) and can thus get away with less Piety. If you find yourself struggling with mp, ensure that you're effectively using your mp tools before adding more Piety. Swapping GCD heals for OGCD heals, using Aetherflow and Lucid Dreaming on cooldown, using Recitation  for a free GCD heals in a pinch: these are all effective ways to make your mp go farther. Also make sure to always carry Super-Ethers:hq: when raiding, they are a very effective way to recover from multiple rezzes or a death.

# General Recommendations
The i729 versions of the 2.5 and 2.49 sets are practical all-rounder sets. They are only behind their i727 counterparts by single-digit DPS and offer more HP, piety and magic defense in return.

**2.50** <https://xivgear.app/?page=sl%7Cdd5ad553-40e4-49c0-ab35-5c5cf9b490b7>
**2.49** <https://xivgear.app/?page=sl%7C33be7428-e34c-4f47-81fd-b38f98070baa>

# FRU / Max ilvl Sets
These sets are for people who value eHP or want to start working towards Futures Rewritten (Ultimate). FRU sets are between 2.50/2.49 low piety sets and a higher piety 2.5 set. Choose whichever one seems more in line with your goals.

**2.50** <https://xivgear.app/?page=sl%7Cdf6a55e3-30a0-4dc6-b163-1a6278150075>
**2.49** <https://xivgear.app/?page=sl%7C91a8fdc7-586c-4321-ba6f-763612e07cda>
**2.50 higher piety** <https://xivgear.app/?page=sl%7Cbc44b6b0-344a-46fe-8d4c-bf8747be23ed>

# Max Damage Sets
These sets are for people who are interested in speeds/parsing and want the most damage they can get. These sets use 710 items so your eHP will be lower. The 2.5 set may parse better with higher variance but 2.31 has more consistent damage.

**2.50** <https://xivgear.app/?page=sl%7C1fa4c759-bd26-402e-90e3-109e6379e081>
**2.31** <https://xivgear.app/?page=sl%7Ce2ddde5b-2846-4c2d-87f1-a6a990612a00>

# Endwalker Ultimate/Criterion Sets
These sets are for Dragonsong Reprise(ultimate) and The Omega Porotol(ultimate) and Criterion Dungeons. For The Omega Protocol you can sync gear but it is way better to actually take the time to farm gear, you'll squeeze out more damage which can help with groups progging and playing a bit too safe.

**DSR** The piety requirements vary depending on your p7 strat for akh morns. 332 requires more GCD healing while 611 is laxer. Choose a GCD based on the gear you're willing to farm. 2.5 provids mainly sync gear while 2.45/2.40 has p1s-p4s raid gear

# information 

## 2.5GCD and 2.49 GCD info

In the game, your global cooldown (GCD) timing is determined by when the game code aligns with your frame updates. This happens once per frame. If your next action doesn't sync perfectly with these frames, there can be slight delays in your GCD. This is especially noticeable on lower FPS. Fluctuating frame rates can also make your GCD more unpredictable. Over the course of a battle, these delays could mean that a gear set with a supposed 2.5 GCD might actually function more like a 2.505 GCD. Players with higher FPS will suffer the effects of this issue less but will never be able to fully eliminate them. 

Third-party tools like ReAction help to mitigate this effect by syncing your frames with when your GCD is ready. To better understand how this works for your specific character, you can make comparisons using a GCD calculator. By inputting fflogs into the calculator, you can see the actual duration of your GCDs during gameplay. It's advisable to use multiple logs for accuracy and disregard any anomalous data. For a practical tool to calculate GCDs, you can visit <https://gcdcalc.fly.dev/.>

## Dot Refresh 

If using the Early Refresh(DoT clip) opener: The 2.50 GCD and 2.49 GCD sets will NOT land Biolysis under Chain Stratagem if you use Biolysis AFTER your 6th Energy Drain in the opener (the breakpoint is 2.47 GCD and requires low ping). To fix this, use Biolysis on the same GCD as your 6th Energy Drain.

This write up by <@145919664575217664> helps explain how some gear sets could be better for parsing despite having weaker sim damage and overall performance.
