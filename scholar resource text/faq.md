## :bceWhat: **Is Pet Potency still a thing for SCH?**
when SCH is alone and does not have role bonuses, their fairy’s potencies will be roughly 95-96% of the SCH’s. As a point of reference, this means that Fey Blessing, an ability with a listed value of 320p that comes directly from the fairy, is equal to roughly a 301p-304p heal coming directly from the Scholar.

In full parties with max role bonus, fairy’s potencies will be roughly 90-91% of their listed potencies. Using the example above, Fey Blessing shows a 320p heal, but will actually heal 288p-291p in function.

Currently fairy has a bug, you can read more in [SCH Questions.](https://discord.com/channels/277897135515762698/277965183366987776/1280291155606634507)

## :bceWhat:  **Should I still be using Ruin II :RuinII: ? If so, when?**
Now that we have free weaves with Broil, we want to avoid using Ruin II whenever possible. You should be slidecasting using Broil to get to where you need to be, and single weaving oGCDs after Broil. You can still use natural Bio refreshes to double weave and move longer distances, and Swiftcast can be used to move longer distances in a pinch. If you find yourself badly out of position, or a mechanic simply isn't able to be dealt with using these methods, you can use Ruin II for the movement rather than just dropping cast. You can also use Ruin II if you absolutely need to get out 2 oGCDs right away, this can usually be avoided on future pulls with better planning.

## ** :bceWhat:  I’ve heard that double shield is extremely strong in [pick your fight]. Does this make regen healers obsolete?**
Not at all. In the game’s current design, regen healers will always have a place in standard compositions. Though both Sage and Scholar can fill the pure/regen niche at different times in the double shield composition, nothing beats the ability to have accessible pure healing GCDs that are always available and strong, pure healing oGCDs. The value of having two effective spam GCDs (E. Prog/Concitation + Helios Conjunction/Medica III) should never be understated.

## ** :bceWhat:  I love SGE and my cohealer loves SCH. When can we swap to double shield?**
At the end of the day, it’s your prog and your raid. If you and your team are comfortable accepting the composition’s weaknesses, feel free to play it when you are ready. This composition becomes easier to play the further we are from week 1 of a new tier. As you get more gear and as people become familiar with fights, double shield gains viability. A SCH/SGE duo in a party where everyone is maximum item level will be vastly different than a SCH/SGE duo in a party full of crafted gear.

## **:bceWhat:  Why shouldn’t I take double shield (SGE/SCH) in blind prog?**
Though double shield can be incredibly strong, it’s likely not the best heal composition for entering and progging a fight fully blind. A double shield composition’s strength hinges on an understanding of the fight’s damage timeline: if we know exactly when every instance of damage in a fight is, it’s much easier to script a mitigation plan with two healers that can provide 19% mitigation every 30s. In blind prog, spam GCDs are crucial: if you don’t understand a mechanic’s damage profile, then you want to throw whatever you have at it in order to survive. Though SCH’s Concitation and SGE’s Eukrasian Prognosis III are both incredibly strong buttons by themselves, the overheal granted by the shields does not stack. As such, one instance of Concitation + E. Prog III provides 300 healing potency and a single additional 360p shield. Notably, this can make recovery before or after the damage instance more difficult, especially in a setting with several hits over an extended duration. Alternatively, one use of SCH’s Concitation with AST’s Helios Conjunction can provide 450 healing potency, a 360p shield, and an 875p party regen.

## ** :bceWhat:  With the updates to Sage and Scholar, isn’t double shield broken?**
To some extent! The two jobs by themselves are incredibly useful in any heal composition. While Seraphism allows SCH to spam high-potency pure heals due to the quick cooldown on Emergency Tactics while the skill is active, it’s on a 3 minute cooldown and not something that’s readily available. Additionally, getting maximum value out of it depends on you and your cohealer knowing the fight’s timeline.
