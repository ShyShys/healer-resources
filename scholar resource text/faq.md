**Endwalker FAQ**

**Is pet potency still a thing for SCH?** (last tested in endwalker)
Yes unfortunately, though it's significantly better now. In solo play the fairy's potency is worth ~0.93x player potency, in a party with the full 5% role bonus it's worth ~0.89x player potency.

**Should I still be using Ruin II :RuinII: ? If so, when?**
Now that we have free weaves with Broil, we want to avoid using Ruin II whenever possible. You should be slidecasting using Broil to get to where you need to be, and single weaving oGCDs after Broil. You can still use natural Bio refreshes to double weave and move longer distances, and Swiftcast can be used to move longer distances in a pinch. If you find yourself badly out of position, or a mechanic simply isn't able to be dealt with using these methods, you can use Ruin II for the movement rather than just dropping cast. You can also use Ruin II if you absolutely need to get out 2 oGCDs right away, this can usually be avoided on future pulls with better planning.
