:small_blue_diamond:How to show your fairy nameplate in battle:

A. Character config > Control Settings > "Target" tab > Under "Target Settings", Uncheck "Disable targetting of pets and minions when in battle."
B. Character config > Display Name Settings > "Own" tab > Under "Pets" set "Display Name Settings" to "Always" or "During Battle"

Both options must be set this way or your fairy nameplate will be hidden.

:small_blue_diamond: Placing your Fairy

It's important to note that Placing your fairy DOES NOT require a weave slot and thus can be done while casting another ability without causing any sort of clipping. For the same reason, macroing Place does not have any of the drawbacks that most combat macros will incur, and many SCHs will use a macro for Place. Several different macros can be useful, but the following is a good general usage one. 

This macro will allow you to Place and Heel with the same button. It works by setting your fairy to Heel and then bringing up the Place targeting reticle. Simply cancel the Place targeting to keep her on Heel.

```/merror off
/pac Heel
/pac Place
/micon "Place" pet ```

:small_blue_diamond: Scholar and Auto-Attacks

Should I care about auto-attacks on Scholar? 

TLDR: Yes but never play greedy for autos. While your autos won't do anywhere near as much as a tank, melee, or phys ranged, Scholar actually has a very high base strength stat which makes our autos do a noticeable amount of damage if maintained over the course of a fight. Simply having auto-attacks enabled and staying in melee range when possible can give you as much damage as an extra Broil or more in total. You should never try to greed autos, and you certainly shouldn't be taking melee uptime spots from an actual melee job, but autos are straight up free damage in many situations, and not a totally insignificant amount. 

Is there an easier way to start auto-attacking when I retarget the boss?

Yes, bind the Confirm button to a key. Hitting your Confirm keybind while targeted on an enemy will initiate auto-attacks. Remember you need to do this every time you retarget the boss, but it doesn't require any sort of weaving space.
