**Remember that the exact ability usage in these openers is not strict.** If you need to use a heal in the opener or hold an AF stack for later healing do so. This is the ability usage you'd do on a dummy, but not every fight allows for it.

:large_blue_diamond: **Level 90 Openers**:
The Swift Opener is better for personal dps if done correctly, not necessarily better for rdps. If you wanna hold Diss just drop it and the 3 EDs after it from the opener. As always, feel free to hold AF stacks for healing if they'll be needed.

:small_blue_diamond: **No Swift Opener**: 5 EDs in Chain, easy to execute

:small_blue_diamond: **Swift Opener**: 6 EDs in Chain if done properly, requires a bit of Spell Speed (2.43 GCD should be plenty). The ED directly after chain cannot be used until the chain debuff actually applies to the enemy, or else it won't get the crit buff. **Don't do this opener if you're not going to be trying for all 6 EDs**

:small_blue_diamond: **Dissipation First Openers:** You can swap Aetherflow (AF) and Dissipation in both of the above openers. Using Dissipation First has several advantages: the fairy comes back about 15s earlier due to an earlier Dissipation (giving access to her healing again), the 2000mp from AF comes later (meaning it won't be wasted to overcapping), and it aligns AF correctly for a 6 ED buff window at 2 minutes. The last benefit is minor as you can simply delay the 2 minute AF instead if using an AF first opener. The main drawback of doing a Dissipation first opener is the risk of losing an AF use over the course of the fight or the phase, though this risk is shared by any rotation that does 6 ED buff windows every 2 minutes. It also changes the timings of when you get AF stacks back which make an impact on your healing plan. Consider the positives and negatives of Dissipation first when planning out the fight.
