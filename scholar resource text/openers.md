**Remember that the exact ability usage in these openers is not strict.** If you need to use a heal in the opener or hold an AF stack for later healing do so. This is the ability usage you'd do on a dummy, but not every fight allows for it.

## :large_blue_diamond: **Level 90 Openers**:
 If you wanna hold Diss just drop it and the 3 EDs after it from the opener. As always, feel free to hold AF stacks for healing if they'll be needed. See below about clipping biolysis at the end of raid buffs

## :small_blue_diamond: **Dissipation First Openers:** 

You can swap Aetherflow (AF) and Dissipation in both of the above openers. Using Dissipation First has several advantages: the fairy comes back about 15s earlier due to an earlier Dissipation (giving access to her healing again), the 2000mp from AF comes later (meaning it won't be wasted to overcapping), and it aligns AF correctly for a 6 ED buff window at 2 minutes. The last benefit is minor as you can simply delay the 2 minute AF instead if using an AF first opener. The main drawback of doing a Dissipation first opener is the risk of losing an AF use over the course of the fight or the phase, though this risk is shared by any rotation that does 6 ED buff windows every 2 minutes. It also changes the timings of when you get AF stacks back which make an impact on your healing plan. Consider the positives and negatives of Dissipation first when planning out the fight.


## :small_blue_diamond **refreshing dot at the end of chain:**

With the changes to raid buffs becoming at least 20 seconds, clipping your dot at the end of buffs become a slight lost for scholars and then after just one additional buff window that clip becomes a gain. For a group with at least one additonal raid buffs than scholar this becomes a gain overall for the party. Below is a small calculator that can show you gain over time. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x9JygMth9UN2nfGiSOAUWSvGtVoBOy7ooKKFSZXyBVI/edit?usp=sharing> make sure you file > make a copy so you can edit the blue section.

## :small_blue_diamond **prepull broil timing:**

You can prepull broil before 1.5s spells have an application time and the boss is pulled during that application time now when the cast is finished. Scholars with good ping can pull at -2.3 seconds, this all depends on ping you can use the doc below to view application time for each spell. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Emevsz5_oJdmkXy23hZQUXimirZQaoo5BejSzL3hZ9I/edit?gid=1964017584#gid=1964017584>
