**Remember that the exact ability usage in these openers is not strict.** If you need to use a heal in the opener or hold an AF stack for later healing do so. This is the ability usage you'd do on a dummy, but not every fight allows for it.

## :bceMad5Angry5: **Level 90 Openers**:
 If you wanna hold Diss just drop it and the 3 EDs after it from the opener. As always, feel free to hold AF stacks for healing if they'll be needed. See below about clipping biolysis at the end of raid buffs

## :bceMad5Angry5: **Dissipation First Openers:** 

You can swap Aetherflow (AF) and Dissipation in both of the above openers. Using Dissipation First has several advantages: the fairy comes back about 15s earlier due to an earlier Dissipation (giving access to her healing again), the 2000mp from AF comes later (meaning it won't be wasted to overcapping), and it aligns AF correctly for a 6 ED buff window at 2 minutes. The last benefit is minor as you can simply delay the 2 minute AF instead if using an AF first opener. The main drawback of doing a Dissipation first opener is the risk of losing an AF use over the course of the fight or the phase, though this risk is shared by any rotation that does 6 ED buff windows every 2 minutes. It also changes the timings of when you get AF stacks back which make an impact on your healing plan. Consider the positives and negatives of Dissipation first when planning out the fight.

## :bceMad5Angry5: **refreshing dot at the end of chain:**

With the changes to raid buffs becoming at least 20 seconds, clipping your dot at the end of buffs become a slight lost for scholars and then after just one additional buff window that clip becomes a gain. For a group with at least one additonal raid buff, this becomes a dps gain overall for the party. Below is a small calculator that can show you gain over time. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x9JygMth9UN2nfGiSOAUWSvGtVoBOy7ooKKFSZXyBVI/edit?usp=sharing> make sure you make a copy of the sheet so you can edit the blue section

**Note for 2nd gcd chain**
Clipping the DoT in buffs will now take at least two buffs or two one-buff windows to make up for the clipping loss.

## :bceMad5Angry5: **why second gcd chain?**
As an rdps class our chain is always best put to line up with our dps' burst, as of dawntrail we just ended up at 2nd gcd.
