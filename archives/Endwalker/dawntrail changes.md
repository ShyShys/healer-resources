# :bceHatBFit: **What do these changes mean for Scholar?**

Scholar in Dawntrail is simply a better version of itself in Endwalker. Seraphishm fills two major holes in scholars kit, total healing throughput and healing while moving; giving access to instant heals/shields and effectively a 20% healing boost to GCD healing, scholar can now better handle extreme healing checks, especially during high movement mechanics. 

The reduction of Recitation's cooldown to 60 second can easily allow for more uses of it even when it is paired with Deployment Tactics. Recitation is a flexible ability and extra uses of it allows Scholar to do so much more. It can be used for more consistent shield strength through guaranteed critical Succors in between Deploys, where it would also help with MP management, or simply for more free AoE healing through Recitation Indoms. While deployment is a 90 second cooldown and recitation is a 60 second cooldown you will often not be using deployment on cooldown every 90 seconds freeing up some room for recitation uses with other abilities and spells.

# :bceCoolShades:  **Does this make things harder on us**

Seraphism conflicts with Dissipation meaning you can't activate Seraphism while your fairy is away and you can't Dissipate while Seraphism is active. Dissipation now locks scholar out of even more of its toolkit which can cause problems and must be adjusted around.
