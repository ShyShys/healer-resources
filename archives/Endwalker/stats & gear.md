:small_blue_diamond: Please read the section on managing Piety below as well.

:large_blue_diamond: Level 90 Stat Priority: Crit>DH>=Det for pre-BiS melding. Consider melding Det over DH for prog, as the damage benefits are basically equal on average. Meld SpS to a comfy tier if you wish, low priority during prog. 

Piety is a binary stat, as any more than you needed to not run out of mp was wasted stats. Because of this, when choosing our substats, avoiding excess Piety is the best way for us to increase our damage, and you'll sometimes see our low piety sets use lower ilvl equipment to avoid Piety (this is still the exception rather than the rule, don't actively use lower ilvl items to dodge Piety without calculating out the gain yourself). It's hard to predict exactly how much Piety you might need in most settings, but you can take a look at how much the recommended sets take in each setting and decide which one fits you best. Remember that slower GCD tiers use significantly less mana (1 less Broil per minute is 400 mp saved per minute) and can thus get away with less Piety. If you find yourself struggling with mp, ensure that you're effectively using your mp tools before adding more Piety. Swapping GCD heals for OGCD heals, using Aetherflow and Lucid Dreaming on cooldown, using Recitation  for a free GCD heals in a pinch: these are all effective ways to make your mp go farther. Also make sure to always carry Super-Ethers:hq: when raiding, they are a very effective way to recover from multiple rezzes or a death.

**6.55 Savage Gear Sets**
Sets and approximate DPS comparison are available at
<https://xivgear.app/#/bis/sch/endwalker/anabaseios>
We will be trying to present our sets in links like above. Message @shyshy with any feedback you have

**2.40 Mid-Pi Set**
This set is a good for those who want extra mp economy for unoptimized environments such as Party finder. 2.40 has good Chain alignment, but poor bio alignment

**2.40 Lo-pi Set**
This set is a good all around choice for those who need to deal with unoptimized environments such as Party Finder. 2.40 has good Chain alignment, but poor Bio alignment.

---------------------------


:blank: 
**2.40 Min Pi DH BiS** (DO NOT USE IN UNOPTIMZED ENVIRONMENTS) 
This set has slightly lower average damage than the SpS BiS but is less ping sensitive and has better MP economy due to a slower GCD. 2.40 gives perfect Chain alignment, but poor Bio alignment.

**2.31 Min Pi SpS BiS** (DO NOT USE IN UNOPTIMIZED ENVIRONMENTS) 
This set has the highest average damage of the two BiS sets and is the more consistent one. It has very dangerous MP economy due to the fast GCD and min Piety. 2.31 gives it good Chain and Bio alignment. 

You can find these and other sets listed with their dps in the SCH gear calc. Please don't leave the master sheet open as it causes slowdown when many people have the same sheet open. You can Make a Copy of the sheet from the File menu.

For your own gear comparisons I recommend using the combined Healer Gear Planner <https://bit.ly/Healer-Gear>

 **ULTIMATE SETS**

**6.5 TOP Prog Sets**

**Note: These sets have minimum piety, since in TOP, one death often leads to a wipe and downtime allows us to regenerate MP. If you want more MP, you can bring mana pots or swap Crit/Det gear out for Crit/Piety gear.**

<https://xivgear.app/#/bis/sch/endwalker/top>

**2.40 sps relic TOP** 
**2.31 sps relic TOP**
These two sets are two pretty decent GCDs for TOP both makes slidecasting panto and exaflares easier.

**2.40 det relic TOP**
This set sims out slightly higher than the 2.40 sps relic, however I know most people use the sps relic. If you have a det relic you can go for this.

**6.4 DSR Sets**

**The piety requirements vary depending on your p7 strat for akh morns. 332 requires more GCD healing while 611 is laxer.**

**Note: A synced 645 relic will be the best weapon for DSR and TOP. However if you don't have it use the etro link above to make a set and reduce the amount of stat lost. **

https://xivgear.app/#/bis/sch/endwalker/dsr

**332 set**
A very good amount of piety for prog and a slow GCD to help conserve mp. **Suggested if you're currently progging the fight**

**611 set** 
If you use this set with 332 or you're unsure how to properly manage your mana you will oom. **Suggested if you want to optimize after clearing**

**TEA, UWU, and UCOB gear**
For these fights, the easiest thing to do is just to use the synced gear. You can use `!faq ultimatesync` to see the ilvl requirements to max both substats with synced gear in each fight. Note that even 580 and 590 gear will work fine in TEA even if it doesn't fully cap the lower substat. If you have the ShB relic weapon it's BiS in all 3 of these fights. Stat caps for it can also be found in `!faq ultimatesync`.

You can find extra sets in the calc. Please don't leave the master sheet open as it causes slowdown when many people have the same sheet open. You can Make a Copy of the sheet from the File menu. <https://bit.ly/SCHDMGCalc>
